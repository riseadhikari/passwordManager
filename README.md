# passwordManager
Building a very secure password manager, protected using encryptions and password.

This Project is for local use only. 
Note: Experience with Django preferred.

Let's begin.

hey Guys this is a passwordManager webapp written in python using Django Framework. 

To implement this follow these steps:

1) Install required packages using requirements.txt
      pip install -r requirements.txt

2) Setup a postgresql database with a password.
3) Create a file with name 'config' without any extensions. then add these lines in the file
      {
	    "SECRET_KEY":"",
	    "DB_USER":"",
	    "DB_NAME":""
}

4) update the empty strings with appropriate values, such as SECRET_KEY, database username, and database name.
5) After doing these steps. you should be ready to run this app. 
6) Running this django webapp is different as I have programmed it differently. 
7) You have to run: python main.py. You will be asked to enter the password of your databse. After you log into the database you will asked to input again: just enter 'runserver', your webapp should run without any problem. 

Final Note: I have changed the port to 19999 so when typing the address in the browser- use 127.0.0.1:19999/
